/**
 * Builds one standalone script per delete action, for people who cannot run the app.
 *
 * Versions up to 2.x shipped these as hand-written JavaScript beside the app. That was a
 * second implementation of the same clicking, and it drifted: a selector fixed in the app
 * stayed broken in the file somebody had downloaded. These are generated from
 * `src/lib/engine/` instead, so there is one source and the two cannot disagree.
 *
 * Each output is an IIFE that starts on paste, reports through `console.log` — the engine
 * falls back to it wherever the app's bridge is absent — and is left unminified, because the
 * whole point is that a person can read what they are about to run in their own account.
